# [WIP] MonkeEngine
MonkeEngine is a 2D physics engine developed in C++ using SFML. This engine is being developed as a learning experience, but the dream is to someday develop a game with it!
The engine is currently still in its early stages of development, currently featuring a custom input system, rigid body collision physics and a component system with much more to come!
